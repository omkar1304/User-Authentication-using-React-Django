# User-Authentication-using-React-Django

This application provides full-stack web authentication, with the frontend built using ReactJS and the backend built with Django REST Framework. Users can register and login through the application, and authentication is managed using JWT tokens. If a user is currently logged in, they can also update their password. In the event that a user forgets their password, they can use the "change password with email" feature, which allows them to receive an email with instructions on how to reset their password.
Additionally, the application's frontend has been developed using the Material UI library, providing a basic, user-friendly interface.
